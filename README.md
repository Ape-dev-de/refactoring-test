# Getting Started
Create new repository
To get started,

1. create new blank private repository, on your personal github account .
2. Clone the repository with the task
`git clone --bare https://github.com/Ape-dev-de/refactoring-test.git`
3. Push to repository created in step 1.
`git push --mirror <your-repo-url>`
4. give `BlckStar` viewer-access on that repository via Setting -> Manage access -> Invite Team "BlckStar"
5. You're free to take the test whenever you want and take as much time as you want, but as better the result, the higher the chance i will contract you. 
6. Good Luck and Have fun.

# Installation
run `composer install`

# Start
run `docker-compose up`
<p>The api is accessible on <a href="http://localhost:8123/api/quote">http://localhost:8123/api/quote</a></p>

# Task
- refactor the QuoteController, and rest of the app if neccessary
- fix any bugs when there are some
- write useful/meaningful tests
- document the processes from a business perspective in that readme

# Hint
- think of this project as if this is a REAL application and you want to deploy it to production
The most important things i wish to test are
- Basic undersstanding of PHP
- Testing Skills
- SOLID code
- decoupling / seperation of concern
- security issues
- readability of code
